# Project Flux

## What is this?
It's a very WIP custom IDE for personal use.

## Will there be public access?
I intend to make this open source (of course, otherwise why put it on GitHub?).

## Can I be a tester?
I have no plans on a release or test phase for this yet.

This project is more of a slow, "when-I-can-be-bothered" thing.
